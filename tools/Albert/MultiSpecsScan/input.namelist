! Dimensional quantities in this program are normalized to "reference" values:
! \bar{B} = reference magnetic field, typically 1 Tesla.
! \bar{R} = reference length, typically 1 meter.
! \bar{n} = reference density, typically 10^19 m^{-3}, 10^20 m^{-3}, or something similar.
! \bar{m} = reference mass, typically either the mass of hydrogen or deuterium.
! \bar{T} = reference temperature in energy units, typically 1 eV or 1 keV.
! \bar{v} = \sqrt{2 * \bar{T} / \bar{m}} = reference speed
! \bar{Phi} = reference electrostatic potential, typically 1 V or 1 kV.

! You can choose any reference parameters you like, not just the values
! suggested here. The code "knows" about the reference values only through
! the 3 combinations Delta, alpha, and nu_n, input below.

! Radial gradients of density, temperature, and electrostatic potential are
! specified as derivatives with respect to psi_N, where psi_N is the 
! toroidal flux normalized to the value at the last closed flux surface. 
! (psi_N=0 is the magnetic axis, and psi_N=1 is the last closed flux 
! surface.)

&flowControl
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  ! Options for program flow control:
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  programMode = 1
  ! Options for 'programMode':
  ! 1 = Solve for a single set of numerical parameters.
  ! 2 = Scan the numerical parameters to test for convergence, keeping the physics parameters fixed.
  ! 8 = Scan E_r (i.e., dPhiHatdpsiN)

  ! If you make the sign of programMode negative, the program will print the number of runs required
  ! for the scan corresponding to abs(programMode) and then exit without actually carrying out any solves.

  RHSMode = 1
  ! Options for RHSMode:
  ! 1 = Solve for a single right-hand side.
  ! 2 = Solve for three right-hand sides to get the full 3x3 transport matrix.
  ! At present, RHSMode 2 is not working for multiple species

  outputFilename = "sfincsOutput.h5"

  outputScheme = 1
  ! Options for outputScheme:
  ! 0 = Do not save any HDF5 file.
  ! 1 = Do save an HDF5 file.

  ! If the following switch is set to true, a Matlab m-file is created which
  ! stores the matrix, right-hand side, and solution vector.  If an iterative solver is used,
  ! the preconditioner matrix is also saved.
  ! PETSc usually generates an error message if the size of the linear system is more then 1400 x 1400,
  ! so usually this setting should be false.
!  saveMatlabOutput = .true.
  saveMatlabOutput = .false.

  MatlabOutputFilename = "sfincsMatrices.m"

  ! If the following switch is set to true, the matrix, right-hand-side, and solution of the
  ! linear system will be saved in PETSc's binary format.  The preconditioner matrix will also
  ! be saved if tryIterativeSolver == .true.

  !saveMatricesAndVectorsInBinary = .true.
  saveMatricesAndVectorsInBinary = .false.

  binaryOutputFilename = "sfincsBinary"

  parallelizeOverScan = .true.
!  parallelizeOverScan = .false.

  ! If the parameter below is false, the linear system will not actually be solved.
  ! Sometimes it is useful to run the code without solving the system in order to quickly
  ! output profiles or for debugging.
  solveSystem = .true.
!  solveSystem = .false.

  ! Roughly speaking, Delta is rho_* at the reference parameters.

  collisionOperator = 0
  ! 0 = Full linearized Fokker-Planck operator
  ! 1 = pitch-angle scattering with no momentum-conserving term

  !  0 = no constraints
  !  1 = 2 constraints: <n1>=0 and <p1>=0

  ! You should probably set constraintScheme to -1 except in rare circumstances.

  ! To use one of the 4 most common trajectory models, the remaining parameters

!  useDKESExBDrift = .true.
  useDKESExBDrift = .false.
  ! If useDKESExBDrift=true, the ExB drift term in the df/dtheta and df/dzeta terms is taken
  ! to be E x B / <B^2> instead of E x B / B^2.

  !include_fDivVE_term = .true.
  include_fDivVE_term = .false.
  ! If true, a term f_{s1} div (v_E) is included in the kinetic equation.
  ! This term may make sense to include with the partial trajectory model
  ! as it restores Liouville's theorem (particle conservation) and eliminates 
  ! the need for either a particle or heat source.

&resolutionParameters
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  ! Numerical resolution parameters:
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  ! For each set of 4 numbers below, the first is the value used in a single run.
  ! The second and third numbers set the range by which the first number is scaled
  ! in a convergence scan. The fourth number sets the number of values tried in a
  ! convergence scan. The code attempts to space the values evenly in a logarithmic
  ! sense, as in Matlab's 'logspace' function. For example, the following settings
  ! Ntheta = 6
  ! NthetaMinFactor = 0.5
  ! NthetaMaxFactor = 2.0
  ! NthetaNumRuns = 3
  ! would mean the values Ntheta = 3, 6, and 12 would be tried in a scan.
  ! If you don't want to scan a variable in a convergence scan, set the associated
  ! xxxNumRuns parameter to 0.
  
  ! Number of grid points in the poloidal direction.
  ! Memory and time requirements DO depend strongly on this parameter.
  Ntheta = 5
  NthetaMinFactor = 1
  NthetaMaxFactor = 2

  NzetaMinFactor = 1
  NzetaMaxFactor = 2
  NzetaNumRuns = 0

  ! Number of Legendre polynomials used to represent the distribution function.
  ! Memory and time requirements DO depend strongly on this parameter.
  ! The value of this parameter required for convergence depends strongly on
  ! the collisionality. At high collisionality, this parameter can be as low
  ! as ~ 5. At low collisionality, this parameter may need to be many 10s or
  ! even > 100 for convergence.
  Nxi = 8
  NxiMinFactor = 1
  NxiMaxFactor = 2
  NxiNumRuns = 0
  
  ! Number of Legendre polynomials used to represent the Rosenbluth
  ! potentials. Except in exceptional circumstances, this number should be 4.
  ! Memory and time requirements do NOT depend strongly on this parameter.
  NL = 4
  NLMinFactor = 1
  NLMaxFactor = 2
  NLNumRuns = 0
  
  ! Number of grid points in energy used to represent the distribution function.
  ! Memory and time requirements DO depend strongly on this parameter.
  ! This parameter almost always needs to be at least 5.
  ! Usually a value in the range 5-8 is plenty for convergence, though sometimes
  ! you may need to go up to 10-15.
  Nx = 5

  xMaxMinFactor = 1
  xMaxMaxFactor = 2

  ! Tolerance used to define convergence of the Krylov solver.
  ! This parameter does not affect memory requirements but it does affect the
  ! time required for solution somewhat
  solverTolerance = 1d-6
  solverToleranceMinFactor = 1d-1
  solverToleranceMaxFactor = 1
  solverToleranceNumRuns = 0

  forceOddNthetaAndNzeta = .true.
  ! If forceOddNthetaAndNzeta is set to true, 1 is added to Ntheta any time a run is attempted with even Ntheta,
  ! and 1 is added to Nzeta any time a run is attempted with even Nzeta.
  ! This can be useful because the iterative solvers sometimes do not work with even Ntheta or Nzeta.
  ! This parameter should be true unless you know what you are doing.

  ! Options for whichParallelSolverToFactorPreconditioner:
  ! 1 = use mumps if it is detected, otherwise use superlu_dist

  ! The value of whichParallelSolverToFactorPreconditioner is only used when morpheus is run with

  ! Otherwise, matrices are not distributed across processors, so the PETSc built-in serial sparse
  ! direct solver is used to factor the preconditioner.

  PETSCPreallocationStrategy = 1
  ! This setting changes the estimated number of nonzeros (nnz) used for allocating memory for the matrix and preconditioner.
  ! 0 = Old method with high estimated nnz. This method works consistently but uses WAY more memory than necessary.
  ! 1 = New method with lower, more precise estimated nnz.  This method has been less thoroughly tested, but it should use much less memory.
