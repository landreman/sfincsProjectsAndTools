* DONE Er search creates too many simulations?
** DONE Bug in how new Er is extrapolated?
** TODO Could be better, but it works as intended.
* DONE OOM simulations with less helpful error message not restarted
  Check if this works
* DONE OOM simulations never look for manually started simulations
  Check if this works now
* DONE TIME simulations never look for manually started simulations
  Check if this works now
* DONE TIME simulations never increase time limit
  Check if this works now
* DONE Restarting Er scan
  Check if it works?
* DONE Check if can rerun "done" scan without any new simulations being started.




* DONE States of outputs
** TODO  Running
** TODO  Finished
** TODO  OOM
** TODO  time
  KSP not-converged


* DONE simulMockup
** Mock the stdout and stderr of simulation
** Mock the output of squeue

* DONE sfincs_utils
** Perhaps rename to simul_utils?
   Has wrappers so that the real simulations can be easily replaced by the mockupsabove.
** Wrap squeue
** Wrap sbatch

* DONE State determined from stderr and stdout (ErrOut object)
** DONE DONE, TIME, OOM works and tests in place.
** TODO KSP non-converged: not implemented

* DONE States of individual simulations (Simulation object)
  Queued (if job ID exists in squeue and none of the below is true)
  Maybe-queued (if job ID is not known and none of the below is true)
  Running (if stderr is empty but stdout is not)
  Finished (if stdout indicates finished simulation)
  OOM (if stderr indicates)
  time (if stderr indicates)
  KSP not-converged (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

** Variables that can be changed by simulation itself
 -  time limit
 -  number of nodes
 -  icntl parameters
 -  KSP parameters
 -  preconditioner?
 In general, they shouldn't change the "interpretation" of the simulation
 with respect to the simulgroup.

* DONE State of simulgroup
  0: running convergence scan
  1: running intermittent Er scan
  2: running final Er scan
  3: running follow-up convergence scan
  9: all done
  4: as low as possible convergence scan???

** "Variables" the simulgroup can change
   Add new simulations (with new values in resolution, Er, etc.)
   Discard old simulations (maybe)
   
* DONE State visualizer
  Viewer:
     Expand simulgroup
        Copy simulation
        Expand simulation
            Edit simulation
                Plot simulation
     Copy simulgroup
     
* TODO Better resolution estimate
** TODO Script to run over simulations to extract input, geometry and numerical convergence status
   ~/sfincsProjectsAndTools/tools/Stefan/sfincs_resolution/data/conv_data_from_scan.py
** TODO Geometry representation useful to assess resolution requirements
** TODO Categorizer that accounts for symmetry in input (SVM?)

* TODO Change to collisional and nx preconditioner if needed?
  Might be best to do this manually for now, since memory requirements needs to be as low as possible. Should launch a different kind of scan to find as low resolution as possible for unaffected parameters?


* TODO Lowest possible converged resolution scan
  Useful to change preconditioner, or increase resolution.
  Maybe substates for different resolution parameters?
* TODO Copy simulations/simulgroup
* TODO Edit simulation/simulgroup
* TODO Visualize simulation/simulgroup
* TODO State1 state3 merge
