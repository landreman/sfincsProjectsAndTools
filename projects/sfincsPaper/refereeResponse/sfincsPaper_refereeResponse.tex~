Re: ``Ion runaway in lightning discharges'', by T Fülöp and M
Landreman


Thank you for reading our manuscript. We appreciate your comments and
suggestions for improvements.  We have modified the paper accordingly
and clarified the issues that have been raised.

In the previous version of the paper, we made the simplistic
approximation that the charge-exchange cross-section would be roughly
constant. As one of the referees has pointed out, the cross section
does have significant energy dependence. We have now accounted for the
energy dependence of the cross-section and derived the corresponding
distribution function. We show that the nonmonotonic dependence of the
cross-section on velocity gives rise to an elevated tail of the ion
distribution. Due to the sensitivity of the DD cross section to the
high energy part of the distribution, this elevated tail leads to an
increase in the estimated neutron production. However, we would like
to emphasize the estimates for the neutron production is only one of
many possible applications of the ideas in the paper. 
The insight that ions can be accelerated to very high energies if the
effective ion charge $Z_i$ is much different from one can be useful
in other circumstances. For instance it can lead to improvements in
the design of e.g. plasma-based accelerators. We hope that our paper
will trigger dedicated experiments for testing the idea. But for this
to happen the paper should reach the widest possible audience and we
believe the Physical Review Letters is the best forum for
accomplishing this.


 The main changes in the manuscript are listed below

\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] We have added the new references suggested by the
  referees. We are grateful that these new references have been
  brought to our attention.
\item[2] We added a simpler fit for the charge-exchange cross-section
  $\sigma_x$, accounted for the heavier mass of the deuterium, and
  presented it in a figure to show the correspondence with the more
  complicated one.  Figures 2ab are recalculated with the new
  cross-section.
\item[3] We added a figure showing the energy of the protons and
  deuterium ions in the case when the non-monotonic dependence of
  $\sigma_x$ is included. 
\item[4] The ion distribution function is now derived by solving the
  kinetic equation with the velocity dependent $\sigma_x$. 
  This new distribution function is now used 
  to calculate the neutron production.
\item[5] We rewrote some of the conclusions of the paper according to
  the new results. We also included new insights on the ion runaway
  phenomenon.
\item[6] The statement regarding the impact on carbon-14 dating has
  been removed.
\item[7] We agree with the referees that the decay of Oxygen 15 is
  unlikely to contribute to the observed positron source in
  thunderstorms, and therefore we have now omitted that sentence.
\end{enumerate}
