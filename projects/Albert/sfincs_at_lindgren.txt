Here are notes on getting the fortran version to compile:

module load petsc
(note that this is version 3.2, not 3.3, so a line at the top of solveDKE.F90 needs to be un-commented)
module load hdf5-parallel

in makefile:
commented out the 2 "include" lines
un-commented FLINKER=ftn

commented out make "cleaner"
uncommented make "clean"

We were able to compile if we used dynamic rather than static compiling:
As discussed on 
http://www.pdc.kth.se/resources/computers/lindgren/how-to/compiling
to link with dynamic libraries, the magic incantation is:
export XTPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic


Then at runtime, you have to first run:
export CRAY_ROOTFS=DSL
